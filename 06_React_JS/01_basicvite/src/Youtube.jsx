/*
⚠️ Notes:
🧠 React Rule: Capitalized = Component
React treats anything that starts with an uppercase letter as a custom component. If it starts with a lowercase letter, React assumes it's a built-in HTML tag like div, span, or button.
Ex: above code Youtube is a component

✅  Use .jsx extensions in vite react app
✅  JSX stands for JavaScript XML — it's the syntax used in React to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
✅ Used when your file contains JSX syntax (like <div> or <Component />)
