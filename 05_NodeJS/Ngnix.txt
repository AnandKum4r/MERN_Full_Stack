Nginx (pronounced as "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server that is also used as a:
🔹 Reverse proxy
🔹 Load balancer
🔹 HTTP cache
🔹 Media streaming server

🔄 How Nginx Works Internally
Nginx is event-driven, not thread-based. That means:
🧵 It doesn’t create a new thread for each connection (like Apache does)
⚙️ It uses a main event loop that can handle thousands of connections at once, efficiently
💡 That’s why it uses low memory and scales better under heavy traffic

🔧 What Does Nginx Do?
Imagine you're hosting a website. When users open your site:
➡️ Nginx handles their HTTP requests
➡️ It delivers HTML pages, images, CSS, JS, and more
➡️ It can forward requests to backend servers like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, etc.

⚙️ Common Use Cases
✅ Serve static websites
✅ Host dynamic apps (via reverse proxy to Node.js, Python, etc.)
✅ Act as SSL/TLS terminator
✅ Load balancing traffic between multiple servers
✅ Improve performance with caching
